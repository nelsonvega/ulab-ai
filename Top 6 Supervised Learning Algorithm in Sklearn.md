When it comes to **Machine Learning**, depending on the problem to solve , we could take different approaches. 

One of the primary terms we learn is Supervised Learning. It is  the Data mining process of inferring a function from labeled training data.

Confused? me too.

Let me try again, You have an input X and an output Y, and you know both. For example, letâ€™s say you have a data set with data about people who live in a zip code and their voting history. Using that information, you want to predict if a person in that zip code will be voting next year.

The whole point of supervised learning is about to create a function that maps the relationship between X(input) and Y( the output)

The goal is to approximate the mapping function so close that when you have a new data input, the output is correct.

Now, Supervised Learning can be grouped in:

#### Classification

A classification problem is when the output variable is a category that you want to attach to the input. For example email spam or not, organ donor or not.

#### Regression

Now regression is when things get interesting. Now you want to predict real values, not classifying the data.  
For example:

-   How much money allocated for a specific budget line item?
-   Predict economist growth of a state.
-   Salary estimation.

## Decision Trees
##  Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
##  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors)
##  Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC)
##  Support Vector Machines (SVM)
##  Logistic Regression
